# Is this allowed on Gimkit?

The simplified answer is **yes, as long as you don't use it to cheat or otherwise do anything potentially problematic.**

Special thanks to Josh Feinsilber and Jeff Osborn for clarifying this!

# What is the correct capitalization for Gimhook?

The correct capitalization is `Gimhook`, which is used everywhere except for the logo.

The logo is lowercase because I personally think it looks better. I might change it later though to further standardize on using `Gimhook`.
